**Polynomial Curve Fitting using a Genetic Algorithm**
This project implements a genetic algorithm in Python to perform polynomial curve fitting. The goal is to find the best-fit polynomial that approximates a given set of data points by evolving a population of candidate polynomials over multiple generations.

***Overview***
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are inspired by the process of natural selection. This project demonstrates how GAs can be used to find the best-fit polynomial for a given dataset. The algorithm evolves a population of candidate polynomials by selecting, crossing over, and mutating them over several generations to minimize the error between the predicted and actual data points.

***Requirements***
Python 3.12.0
NumPy
Matplotlib

***Installation***
Clone the repository: git clone -----------------------------------
Navigate to the project directory: cd genetic-algorithm-polynomial-curve-fitting
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended): python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   (On Windows use ".\venv\Scripts\activate")
Install the required packages: pip install numpy matplotlib

***Usage***
Run the genetic algorithm script: python genetic_algorithm.py
The script will output the best polynomial coefficients found and display a plot comparing the best-fit polynomial with the original data points.

***How It Works***
Initialization: A population of random polynomials is generated, where each polynomial is represented by its coefficients.
Fitness Calculation: The fitness of each polynomial is calculated as the negative mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual data points.
Selection: The top-performing polynomials (those with the best fitness scores) are selected as parents for the next generation.
Crossover: The selected parents are combined to produce offspring, with a crossover point determining how much of each parent's coefficients contribute to the offspring.
Mutation: A small mutation is applied to some offspring, introducing randomness to the population and helping the algorithm avoid local minima.
Evolution: This process repeats for a specified number of generations, with the population gradually evolving towards the best-fit polynomial.
***Results***
The best polynomial found by the genetic algorithm will be printed to the console, and a plot will be displayed showing the original data points and the best-fit polynomial curve.
